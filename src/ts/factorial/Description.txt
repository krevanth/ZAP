This test mainly runs a program to find factorial of 5 and write
the value 3.14 to a memory location. IRQ is available and simply
does a push, modify and pop back of registers. At the end an 
SWI is called which performs a bunch of multiplications and 
serial load/store. This setup uses the MMU but is set up for 
identity mapping using sections.
