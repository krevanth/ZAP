This test mainly runs a program to find factorial of 5 and write
the value 3.14 to a memory location. This setup uses the MMU but is set up for 
identity mapping using sections. IRQs are generated using the timer in the
testbench. At the end an SWI is called which performs a bunch of multiplications 
and serial load/store. FIQs are enabled in testbench to be periodically generated
every 256 clock cycles.
