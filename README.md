A simplified block diagram of the ZAP pipeline is shown below:

![Pipeline](Pipeline.drawio.svg)

ZAP includes several microarchitectural enhancements to improve instruction throughput, hide external bus and memory latency and boost performance:

* The ability to continue instruction execution even when the data cache is being filled. The data cache features hit under miss capability. The processor stalls when an instruction that depends on the cache access is decoded.
* Direct mapped instruction and data caches. These caches are virtually indexed and virtually tagged. Individual caches allow code and data to be accessed at the same time. The sizes of these caches can be set during synthesis. Cache size is parameterizable. Cache line width may be set as well.
* Direct mapped instruction and data memory TLBs. Having separate translation buffers allows data and code translation to happen in parallel. The sizes of these TLBs can be set during synthesis. Six different TLB memories are provides, each providing direct mapped buffering for sections, large page and small page, each for instruction and data (3 x 2 = 6). The sizes of these 6 memories is parameterizable.
* A parameterizable store buffer that helps buffer stores when the cache is disabled or if the data access is uncacheable. When the cache is enabled and data is cacheable, the store buffer helps buffer cache clean operations. This is slightly different from a write buffer.
* A 4-state bimodal branch predictor that predicts the outcome of immediate branches and branch-and-link instructions. The branch memory is 2-bit wide and is direct mapped. Aliasing is possible due to absence of a tag field. Note that the ZAP does not include a branch target buffer.
* A 4 deep return address stack that stores the predicted return address of branch and link instructions function return. When a BX LR, MOV PC,LR or a block load with PC in register list, the processor pops off the return address. Note that switching between ARM and Thumb state has a penalty of 11 cycles.
* The ability to execute most ARM instructions in a single clock cycle. The only instructions that take multiple cycles include branch-and-link, 64-bit loads and stores, block loads and stores, swap instructions and BLX2.
* A highly efficient superpipeline with dual feedback networks to minimize pipeline stalls as much as possible while allowing for high clock frequencies. A deep 17 stage superpipelined architecture that allows the CPU to run at relatively high FPGA speeds (140MHz @ xc7a35t-3 Artix-7 FPGA)
* Support for single cycle saturating additions and subtractions for better signal processing performance. Multiplications/MAC take 4 to 5 cycles per operation. Note that the multiplier inside the ZAP processor is not pipelined.

### 1.1. Superpipelined Microarchitecture

ZAP uses a 17 stage execution pipeline to increase the speed of the flow of instructions to the processor. The 17 stage pipeline consists of Address Generator, TLB Check, Cache Access, Memory, Fetch, Instruction Buffer, Thumb Decoder, Pre-Decoder, Decoder, Issue, Shift, Execute, TLB Check, Cache Access, Memory and Writeback.

> To maintain compatibility with the ARMv5TE standard, reading the program counter (PC) will return PC + 8 when read.

During normal operation:

* One instruction is writing out one or two results to the register bank.
  * In case of LDR/STR with writeback, two results are being written to the register bank in a single cycle.
  * All other instructions write out one result to the register bank per cycle.
  * A pending load might write another value. The RF has 3 write ports.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is performing arithmetic, logic or memory address generation operations. This stage also confirms or rejects the branch predictor's decisions. The ALU performs saturation in the same cycle.
* The instruction before that is performing a correction, shift or multiply/MAC operation.
* The instruction before that is performing a register or pipeline read.
* The instruction before that is being decoded.
* The instruction before that is being sequenced to micro-ops (possibly).
  * Most of the time, 1 ARM instruction = 1 micro-op.
  * The only ARM instructions requiring more than 1 micro-op generation are BLX, LDM, STM, SWAP and LONG MULTIPLY (They generate a 32-bit result per micro-op).
  * All other ARM instruction decode to just a single micro-op.
  * This stage also causes branches predicted as taken to be actually executed. The latency for a successfully predicted taken branch is 6 cycles.
* The instruction before that is being being decompressed. This is only required in the Thumb state, else the stage simply passes the instructions on.
* The instruction before that is popped off the instruction buffer.
* The instruction before that is pushed onto the instruction buffer. Branches\
  are predicted using a bimodal predictor (if applicable).
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.
* The instruction before that is accessing the cache/TLB RAM.

The deep pipeline, although uses more resources, allows the ZAP to run at high clock speeds.

#### 1.1.1. Automatic Dual Forwarding Network

The ZAP pipeline has an efficient automatic dual forwarding network with interlock detection hardware. This is done automatically and no software intervention is required. This complex feedback logic guarantees that almost all micro-ops/instructions execute at a rate of 1 every cycle.

The only times a pipeline stalls is when (assume 100% cache hit rate):

* An instruction uses a register that is a data (not pointer) destination for a load instruction within 6 cycles (assuming a load hit).
* The pipeline is executing any multiply/MAC instruction (4 to 5 cycle latency).
  * An instruction that uses a register that is a destination for multiply/MAC adds +1 to the multiply/MAC operation's latency.
* Two back to back instructions require non-zero shift and the second instruction's operand overlaps with the first instruction's destination.

This snippet of ARM code takes 6 cycles to execute:

```
    ADD  R1, R2, R2 LSL #10 (1 cycle)
    ADD  R1, R1, R1 LSL #20 (2 cycles)
    ADD  R3, R4, R5, LSR #3 (1 cycle)
    QADD R3, R3, R3         (1 cycle)
    MOV  R4, R3             (1 cycle)
```

This snippet of ARM code takes only 5 cycles (Possible because of dual feedback network):

```
    ADD  R1, R2, R2, R2     (1 cycle)
    ADD  R1, R1, R1 LSL #2  (1 cycle)
    ADD  R3, R4, R5 LSR #3  (1 cycle)
    QADD R3, R3, R3         (1 cycle)
    MOV  R4, R3             (1 cycle)
```

#### 1.1.2. Single Cycle Load with Writeback

The ZAP can execute LDR/STR with writeback in a single cycle. It will perform a parallel write to the register file with the pointer register and the data register in the same cycle.

#### 1.1.3. Hit Under Miss/Execute Under Miss

Data cache accesses that are performing line fills will not block subsequent instructions from executing. In addition, the data cache supports hit under miss functionality i.e., the cache can service the next memory access (hit) while handing the current line fill (miss). Thus, the ZAP can change the order of completion of memory accesses with respect to other instructions, when possible, in a relatively simple way.

If a store misses and is in the process of a linefill, a subsequent load at the same address will report as a hit during the linefill.

#### 1.1.4. Multi Port Register File

ZAP implements the register file in flip-flops. The register file provides 4 read ports and 3 write ports (A, B and C). The operation is as follows:

| Operation           | Port A | Port B | Port C                               |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Load with Writeback | Used   | Used   | _Free to be used by background load_ |
| Other               | Used   | Unused | _Free to be used by background load_ |

#### 1.1.5. Branch Predictor and Return Address Stack

To improve performance, the ZAP processor uses a bimodal branch predictor. A branch memory is maintained which stores the state of each branch. Note that the predictor can only predict Bcc instructions.

* Correctly predicted Bcc instructions take 8 cycles (taken)/0 cycles (not taken) of latency.
* Bcc mispredicts/Data processing PC changes/BX/BLX takes 12 cycles.
* Loading to PC from memory takes 18 cycles. The bimodal predictor is organized as a direct mapped unit so aliasing is possible. The predictor cannot be disabled.

The processor also implements a 4 deep return address stack. Upon calls to

* BL offset

the potential return address is pushed to a stack in the processor.

On encountering these instructions:

* BX LR,
* MOV PC, LR,
* Load multiple with PC in register list.

the CPU treats them as function returns and will pop return address of the stack much earlier. This results in some performance improvement and reduced branch latency. Correctly predicted return takes 7 cycles, while incorrectly or unpredicted returns take 11 cycles.

### 1.2. External Bus Interface

ZAP features a common 32-bit Wishbone B3 bus to access external resources (like DRAM/SRAM/IO etc). The processor can generate byte, halfword or word accesses. The processor uses CTI and BTE signals to allow the bus to function more efficiently. Registered feedback mode is supported for higher performance. Note that multiprocessing is not readily supported and hence, SWAP instructions do not actually perform locked transfers.

**The bus interface is efficient for burst transfers and hence, cache must be enabled as soon as possible for good performance.**

### 1.3. System Control

Please refer to ref \[1] for CP15 CSR architectural requirements. The ZAP implements the following software accessible registers within its CP15 coprocessor.

NOTE: Cleaning and flushing cache and TLB is only supported for the entire memory. Selective flushing and cleaning of TLB will result in the entire TLB being flushed/cleaned. This is permitted as per the arch spec.

* Register 1: Cache and MMU control.
* Register 2: Translation Base.
* Register 3: Domain Access Control.
* Register 5: FSR.
* Register 6: FAR.
* Register 8: TLB functions.
* Register 7: Cache functions.
  * The arch spec allows for a subset of the functions to be implemented for register 7.
  *   These below are valid value supported in ZAP for register 7. Using other operations will result in UNDEFINED operation.

      | Cache Operation                            | Opcode2 | CRM    |
      | ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
      | Flush instruction and data cache           | 0b000   | 0b0111 |
      | Flush instruction cache                    | 0b000   | 0b0101 |
      | Flush data cache                           | 0b000   | 0b0110 |
      | Clean instruction and data cache           | 0b000   | 0b1011 |
      | Clean data cache                           | 0b000   | 0b1010 |
      | Clean and flush instruction and data cache | 0b000   | 0b1111 |
      | Clean and flush data cache                 | 0b000   | 0b1110 |
* Register 13: FCSE Register.

### 1.4. CPU Ports and Parameters

#### 1.4.1. Parameters

Note that all parameters should be 2^n. Cache size should be multiple of line size and at least 16 x line width. Caches/TLBs consume majority of the resources so should be tuned as required. The default parameters give you quite large caches.

#### 1.4.3. Integration

* To use the ZAP processor in your project:
  *   Get the project files:

      > git clone https://github.com/krevanth/ZAP.git
  * Add all the files in `src/rtl/*.sv` to your project.
  * Add `src/rtl/` to your tool's search path to allow it to pick up SV headers.
  * Instantiate the ZAP processor in your project using this template:

```
       zap_top #(.FIFO_DEPTH              (),
                 .BP_ENTRIES              (),
                 .STORE_BUFFER_DEPTH      (),
                 .DATA_SECTION_TLB_ENTRIES(),
                 .DATA_LPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES  (),
                 .DATA_SPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES  (),
                 .DATA_FPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES  (),
                 .DATA_CACHE_SIZE         (),
                 .CODE_SECTION_TLB_ENTRIES(),
                 .CODE_LPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES  (),
                 .CODE_SPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES  (),
                 .CODE_FPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES  (),
                 .CODE_CACHE_SIZE         ()) u_zap_top (
                 .i_clk                   (),
                 .i_reset                 (),
                 .i_irq                   (),
                 .i_fiq                   (),
                 .o_wb_cyc                (),
                 .o_wb_stb                (),
                 .o_wb_adr                (),
                 .o_wb_we                 (),
                 .o_wb_cti                (),
                 .i_wb_dat                (),
                 .o_wb_dat                (),
                 .i_wb_ack                (),
                 .o_wb_sel                (),
                 .o_wb_bte                ()
       );
```

* The processor provides a Wishbone B3 bus. It is recommended that you use it in registered feedback cycle mode.
* Interrupts are level sensitive and are internally synced to clock.

### 2. Project Environment (Docker)

The project environment requires Docker to be installed at your site. Click [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for instructions on how to install Docker. The steps here assume that the user is a part of the `docker` group.

I (Revanth Kamaraj) would like to thank Erez Binyamin for adding Docker support to allow the core to be used more widely.

#### 2.1. Running TCs

To run all/a specific TC, do:

> make \[TC=test\_name]

See `src/ts` for a list of test names. Not providing a testname will run all tests.

To remove existing object/simulation/synthesis files, do:

> make clean

#### 2.2. Adding TCs

* Create a folder `src/ts/<test_name>`
* Please note that these will be run on the sample TB SOC platform.
  * See `src/testbench/testbench.v` for more information.
* Tests will produce wave files in the `obj/src/ts/<test_name>/zap.vcd`.
* Add a C file (.c), an assembly file (.s) and a linker script (.ld).
*   Create a `Config.cfg`. This is a Perl hash that must be edited to meet requirements. Note that the registers in the `REG_CHECK` are indexed registers. To find those, please do:

    > cat src/rtl/zap\_localparams.svh | grep PHY

    For example, if a check requires a certain value of R13 in IRQ mode, the hash will mention the register number as r25.
* Here is a sample `Config.cfg`:

```
       %Config = ( 
               # CPU configuration.
               DATA_CACHE_SIZE             => 4096,    
               CODE_CACHE_SIZE             => 4096,    
               CODE_SECTION_TLB_ENTRIES    => 8,

               DATA_SECTION_TLB_ENTRIES    => 8,       
               DATA_SPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES      => 32,      
               DATA_LPAGE_TLB_ENTRIES      => 16,      
               BP_DEPTH                    => 1024,    
               INSTR_FIFO_DEPTH            => 4,       
               STORE_BUFFER_DEPTH          => 8,      
      
               # Debug helpers. 
               DEBUG_EN                    => 1,       
                                              # Enables debug print messages. 
                                              # Set DEBUG_EN=0 for synthesis.        
      
               # Testbench configuration.
               MAX_CLOCK_CYCLES            => 100000,  
                                              # Clock cycles to run the 
                                              # simulation for.
      
               REG_CHECK                   => {"r1" => "32'h4", 
                                               "r2" => "32'd3"},      
                                              # Make this an anonymous has with 
                                              # entries like "r10" => "32'h0". 
      
               FINAL_CHECK                 => {"32'h100" => "32'd4", 
                                               "32'h104" => "32'h12345678",
                                               "32'h66" =>  "32'h4"}   
                                              # Make this an anonymous hash
                                              # with entries like 
                                              # Base address of 32-bit word => 
                                              # 32-bit verilog_value. The 
                                              # script compares 4 bytes at 
                                              # once.
        );
```

#### 2.3. Running RTL Lint

To run RTL lint, simply do:

> make lint

#### 2.4. Running Vivado Synthesis

Synthesis scripts can be found here: `src/syn/`

Assuming you have Vivado installed, please do:

> make syn

Timing report will be available in `obj/syn/syn_timing.rpt`

If you had used Docker previously to run a test, or had run synth before, do a

> make clean

first.

#### XDC Setup (Vivado FPGA Synthesis)

* The XDC assumes a 200MHz clock.
* Input assume they receive data from a flop with Tcq = 50% of clock period.
* Outputs assume they are driving a flop with Tsu = 2ns Th=1ns.
* Setting FPGA synthesis to an unattainable frequency may result in better timing closure.
